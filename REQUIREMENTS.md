excelent job!
couple of feedbacks on the updated ADRs

1. Prerequisites Check should be done as a program instead of a prompt.
2. Can you strictly follow the steps i mentioned in my previous message?
3. Do not commit during "Issue resolution" step.
4. Do not `git push -u origin` during the "Branch Management" step.

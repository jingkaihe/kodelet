## 2026-01-08 - Iteration 1

### Feature Completed: base-thread-package

**What was implemented:**
- Created `pkg/llm/base/base.go` with the BaseThread struct
- Defined shared fields with appropriate types:
  - Config (llmtypes.Config)
  - State (tooltypes.State)
  - Usage (*llmtypes.Usage)
  - ConversationID (string)
  - IsPersisted_ (bool)
  - Store (ConversationStore)
  - ToolResults (map[string]tooltypes.StructuredToolResult)
  - SubagentContextFactory (llmtypes.SubagentContextFactory)
  - HookTrigger (hooks.Trigger)
  - Mu, ConversationMu (sync.Mutex)
- Added image constants: MaxImageFileSize (5MB), MaxImageCount (10)
- Added NewBaseThread() constructor for initializing common fields
- Verified compilation with `go build ./pkg/llm/base/...`

**Notes for next iteration:**
- Next feature to implement: `base-thread-getters-setters` - Add getter/setter methods to BaseThread
- The IsPersisted_ field uses an underscore suffix to avoid conflict with the IsPersisted() method

## 2026-01-08 - Iteration 2

### Feature Completed: base-thread-getters-setters

**What was implemented:**
- Added getter/setter methods to the Thread struct (renamed from BaseThread to avoid stutter):
  - `SetState(s tooltypes.State)` - sets the tool execution state
  - `GetState() tooltypes.State` - returns the current state
  - `GetConfig() llmtypes.Config` - returns the LLM configuration
  - `GetConversationID() string` - returns the conversation ID
  - `SetConversationID(id string)` - sets conversation ID and updates hook trigger
  - `IsPersisted() bool` - returns whether thread is being persisted
  - `GetUsage() llmtypes.Usage` - returns usage with mutex lock for thread safety
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all getter/setter methods including:
  - Basic functionality tests for each method
  - Nil safety test for GetUsage
  - Concurrent access test for GetUsage with race detection
- Created mockState implementation for testing

**Naming changes (linter compliance):**
- Renamed `BaseThread` to `Thread` to avoid type stutter (base.BaseThread -> base.Thread)
- Renamed `IsPersisted_` field to `Persisted` (avoid underscores in Go names)
- Renamed `NewBaseThread()` to `NewThread()`

**Verification:**
- All tests pass: `go test ./pkg/llm/base/...`
- Race detector passes: `go test -race ./pkg/llm/base/...`
- Linter passes: `mise run lint`

**Notes for next iteration:**
- Next feature to implement: `base-thread-tool-results` - Move structured tool result management methods
- The Thread struct now uses `Persisted` field instead of `IsPersisted_`

## 2026-01-08 - Iteration 3

### Feature Completed: base-thread-tool-results

**What was implemented:**
- Added three structured tool result management methods to `pkg/llm/base/base.go`:
  - `SetStructuredToolResult(toolCallID string, result tooltypes.StructuredToolResult)` - stores a result for a tool call
  - `GetStructuredToolResults() map[string]tooltypes.StructuredToolResult` - returns a copy of all results
  - `SetStructuredToolResults(results map[string]tooltypes.StructuredToolResult)` - replaces all results
- All methods are thread-safe using mutex locking
- GetStructuredToolResults returns a copy using `maps.Copy()` to avoid race conditions
- SetStructuredToolResults makes a copy of the input map to avoid external modifications
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Basic functionality for each method
  - Nil map handling
  - Multiple results
  - Copy semantics (ensuring modifications don't affect original)
  - Concurrent access tests

**Verification:**
- All tests pass: `go test ./pkg/llm/base/...`
- Race detector passes: `go test -race ./pkg/llm/base/...`
- Linter passes: `mise run lint`

**Notes for next iteration:**
- Next feature to implement: `base-thread-auto-compact` - Move shouldAutoCompact() method
- The methods use `maps.Copy()` from Go standard library for consistency

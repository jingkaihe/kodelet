## 2026-01-08 - Iteration 1

### Feature Completed: base-thread-package

**What was implemented:**
- Created `pkg/llm/base/base.go` with the BaseThread struct
- Defined shared fields with appropriate types:
  - Config (llmtypes.Config)
  - State (tooltypes.State)
  - Usage (*llmtypes.Usage)
  - ConversationID (string)
  - IsPersisted_ (bool)
  - Store (ConversationStore)
  - ToolResults (map[string]tooltypes.StructuredToolResult)
  - SubagentContextFactory (llmtypes.SubagentContextFactory)
  - HookTrigger (hooks.Trigger)
  - Mu, ConversationMu (sync.Mutex)
- Added image constants: MaxImageFileSize (5MB), MaxImageCount (10)
- Added NewBaseThread() constructor for initializing common fields
- Verified compilation with `go build ./pkg/llm/base/...`

**Notes for next iteration:**
- Next feature to implement: `base-thread-getters-setters` - Add getter/setter methods to BaseThread
- The IsPersisted_ field uses an underscore suffix to avoid conflict with the IsPersisted() method

# GitHub Actions Integration

Kodelet provides seamless GitHub Actions integration through the [kodelet-action](https://github.com/jingkaihe/kodelet-action), enabling automated software engineering tasks directly in your repository workflows.

## Overview

The Kodelet Action automates software engineering tasks using advanced AI models, including:

* **AI-Powered Engineering**: Automates software engineering tasks using advanced AI models
* **Issue Resolution**: Automatically resolves GitHub issues with code changes and explanations
* **PR Reviews**: Provides intelligent code review comments and suggestions  
* **Background Processing**: Runs asynchronously without blocking your development workflow
* **Multi-Event Support**: Works with issue comments, PR comments, and review comments
* **Secure**: Uses GitHub tokens and API keys securely through GitHub Secrets

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup API Key

Add your Anthropic API key to your repository secrets:

1. Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Value: Your Anthropic API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### 2. Create Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/kodelet.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Background Kodelet

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]

permissions:
  issues: write          # Comment on issues
  pull-requests: write   # Create PRs
  contents: write        # Push commits

env:
  TIMEOUT_MINUTES: "300"

jobs:
  background-kodelet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 360  # 6 hours
    # Only run if @kodelet is mentioned AND the author has proper permissions
    if: |
      (
        # Check if @kodelet is mentioned in the event (issue, comment, or review)
        (github.event_name == 'issues' && contains(github.event.issue.body, '@kodelet')) ||
        (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@kodelet')) ||
        (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@kodelet')) ||
        (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review' && contains(github.event.review.body, '@kodelet'))
      ) &&
      (
        # Verify the author has proper repository permissions (recommended for public repos)
        (github.event.issue.author_association == 'OWNER' || github.event.issue.author_association == 'MEMBER' || github.event.issue.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR') ||
        (github.event.comment.author_association == 'OWNER' || github.event.comment.author_association == 'MEMBER' || github.event.comment.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR') ||
        (github.event.review.author_association == 'OWNER' || github.event.review.author_association == 'MEMBER' || github.event.review.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR')
      )

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set up the dev environment # Setup depends on the nature of your repo
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.24'

      - name: Run Kodelet
        uses: jingkaihe/kodelet-action@v0.1.2-alpha
        with:
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          kodelet-version: 0.0.35.alpha
```

### 3. Trigger Kodelet

Comment `@kodelet` on any issue or pull request to trigger automated assistance:

- **Issues**: `@kodelet please fix this bug`
- **PRs**: `@kodelet review this code`
- **PR Reviews**: Include `@kodelet` in review comments

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Minimal Configuration)

```yaml
- uses: jingkaihe/kodelet-action@v0.1.2-alpha
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    # All other inputs are automatically populated from GitHub context
```

### Custom Configuration

```yaml
- uses: jingkaihe/kodelet-action@v0.1.2-alpha
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    timeout-minutes: 180  # 3 hours
    log-level: debug
    kodelet-version: v0.0.35.alpha  # Pin to specific version
```

## Supported Events

| Event | Description | Kodelet Command |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `issue_comment` | Comments on issues | `kodelet resolve --issue-url` |
| `issue_comment` (on PR) | Comments on pull requests | `kodelet pr-respond --pr-url --issue-comment-id` |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Inline PR review comments | `kodelet pr-respond --pr-url --review-id` |
| `pull_request_review` | PR review submissions | `kodelet pr-respond --pr-url --review-id` |

## Workflow Trigger Conditions

The action only runs when:

1. **Event contains `@kodelet`**: The trigger event (comment, issue, review) must contain `@kodelet`
2. **Author has proper permissions**: Only users with `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` association can trigger the action (highly recommended for public repos, but not mandatory)
3. **Supported event types**: Only specific GitHub events are supported (see table above)

### Trigger Examples

**Issue Comments:**
```
@kodelet please fix this bug by implementing proper error handling
```

**Pull Request Comments:**
```
@kodelet review this code and suggest improvements
```

**Pull Request Review Comments:**
```
This function looks complex. @kodelet can you refactor this?
```

## Permissions Required

The action requires the following GitHub permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  issues: write          # Comment on issues
  pull-requests: write   # Comment on PRs and create PRs
  contents: write        # Push commits and create branches
```

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store your Anthropic API key in GitHub Secrets, never in code
- **GitHub Token**: Uses the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` with limited scope
- **Repository Access**: Only maintainers/collaborators can trigger the action
- **Timeout Protection**: Execution is limited by configurable timeout (default: 5 hours)

## Error Handling

The action automatically handles errors and posts informative comments when execution fails:

- API rate limits or service unavailability
- Complex requirements needing human intervention
- Environmental or dependency issues
- Timeout exceeded

Failed runs include links to workflow logs for debugging.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Action not triggering**
   - Ensure `@kodelet` is included in the comment/issue
   - Check that the user has proper repository permissions
   - Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

2. **API errors**
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly in repository secrets
   - Check API key has sufficient credits/quota

3. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure workflow has proper `permissions` section
   - Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has required scopes



### Debugging

Enable debug logging for more detailed output:

```yaml
- uses: jingkaihe/kodelet-action@v0.1.2-alpha
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    log-level: debug
```

## Versioning

This action follows semantic versioning:

- **Latest stable**: `@v0`
- **Specific version**: `@v0.1.2-alpha`
- **Development**: `@main` (not recommended for production)

## Best Practices

1. **Pin versions in production**: Use specific version tags for stability
2. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Balance between allowing complex tasks and preventing runaway processes
3. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of API usage and costs
4. **Use descriptive comments**: Be specific about what you want Kodelet to do
5. **Review before merging**: Always review Kodelet's changes before merging

## Examples from Kodelet Repository

The Kodelet repository itself uses this action. See [`.github/workflows/kodelet-background.yml`](../.github/workflows/kodelet-background.yml) for a real-world example of the configuration in use.

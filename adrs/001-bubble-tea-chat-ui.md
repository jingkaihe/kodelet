# ADR 001: Bubble Tea Chat UI Interface

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Kodelet currently offers CLI functionality through two main modes: one-shot run mode and basic interactive chat mode. To enhance user experience and provide a more interactive and intuitive interface within the terminal, we're considering implementing a TUI (Terminal User Interface) using the Bubble Tea framework.

Bubble Tea is a Go library for building terminal applications based on The Elm Architecture, providing a robust approach to creating interactive terminal UIs with features like key handling, rendering, and component composition.

## Decision

We will implement a chat interface using the Bubble Tea framework to enhance the interactive mode of Kodelet. This will provide a more intuitive and visually appealing interface while maintaining the terminal-based workflow.

## Details

The Bubble Tea UI will include:

1. **Split View Layout**:
   - Conversation history pane (top/main)
   - User input area (bottom)
   - Optional sidebar for context/status information

2. **Key Components**:
   - Message history with proper formatting for user/assistant messages
   - Input field with editing capabilities
   - Status indicator for processing state
   - Command palette/shortcuts

3. **User Experience Features**:
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Message scrolling with viewport control
   - Visual indicators for thinking/processing
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Model-View-Update architecture following Bubble Tea patterns
   - Custom message rendering with appropriate styling
   - Key binding management
   - Graceful window resizing

## Consequences

### Advantages

- Improved user experience with visual structure and intuitive navigation
- Better readability of conversation history with proper formatting
- More efficient interaction through keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced visual feedback during processing
- Maintains the CLI-focused workflow while adding visual improvements

### Challenges

- Additional dependency on Bubble Tea and related libraries
- Increased complexity in UI state management
- Need for cross-platform terminal compatibility testing
- Learning curve for users familiar with simple CLI

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Plain CLI with colored output**: Simpler but limited interaction capabilities
2. **Web-based interface**: More powerful but deviates from the terminal-focused workflow
3. **Other TUI libraries** (like termui, tview): Less idiomatic with Go or less active development

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a prototype with basic chat functionality
2. Implement message history display with proper formatting
3. Add input handling with editing capabilities
4. Implement status indicators and command palette
5. Add keyboard shortcuts and help documentation
6. Ensure accessibility and cross-platform compatibility

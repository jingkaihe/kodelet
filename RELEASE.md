# Kodelet

## 0.0.3.alpha (2025-05-09)

- Minor tweaks on the chat TUI (e.g. a rad ascii art and processing spinner)
- Added a new command `/help` to show the help message
- Added a new command `/clear` to clear the screen
- Added a new command `/bash` to execute the chat context

### Bug fixes

- Stream out the output from the llm whenever the it responds, instead of buffering it.
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` in the system prompt instead of the time, so that we can have more efficient cache control for the purpose of cost optimisation.

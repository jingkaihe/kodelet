# Following conventions
* When you make changes to a file, first read the file and make sure that you understand the existing coding style, and then make the changes.
* Never assume a library is available. Whenever you want to solve a particular problem with certain library or framework:
  - Check if the library is installed. If so, use it.
  - If the library is not installed, check if a similar library is installed. If so, use it.
  - Otherwise, install the library and use it.
* Always follow the security best practices, and avoid storing secrets in plain text.

# Code Style
IMPORTANT: DO NOT write code comments unless the code block is complicated.

# Workspace Organization
When working with generated or structured workspaces:
* Respect the existing directory structure and naming conventions
* For TypeScript/JavaScript code using ES modules, always include file extensions in imports (`.js`, `.ts`)
* When discovering available tools or modules, examine the file structure first before making assumptions
* Keep workspace-specific files (configs, generated code) in their designated directories

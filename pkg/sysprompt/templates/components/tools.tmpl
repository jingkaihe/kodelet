# !!!VERY IMPORTANT!!! Tool Usage

{{if .Features.subagentEnabled}}
- **ALWAYS prioritize `{{.ToolNames.subagent}}` for open-ended code search, architecture analysis, codebase understanding & analysis, and troubleshooting tasks.** The subagent is specifically designed for these complex, multi-step investigations and will provide better results while reducing context usage.
{{end}}


- **You MUST use parallel tool calling to invoke multiple INDEPENDENT tools AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE** to reduce the latency and context usage by avoiding back and forth communication.
- You can also use parallel tool calling to run multiple `{{.ToolNames.bash}}` commands to conduct multiple independent analysis simultaneously.

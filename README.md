# Kodelet

Kodelet is a lightweight agentic SWE Agent. It runs as an interactive CLI tool in your terminal. It is capable of peforming software engineering and production operating tasks.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Engineering Assistant**: Automates software engineering tasks and production operations with agentic capabilities.
- **Interactive Architecture Design**: Collaboratively design and refine system architectures through natural dialogue.
- **Continuous Code Intelligence**: Analyzes, understands, and improves your codebase while answering technical questions in context.
- **Reusable Fragments/Receipts**: Create template-based prompts with variable substitution and bash command execution for routine tasks. [Learn more â†’](docs/FRAGMENTS.md)
- **Vision Capabilities**: Support for image inputs including screenshots, diagrams, and mockups (Anthropic Claude models).
- **Multiple LLM Providers**: Supports both Anthropic Claude and OpenAI models, giving you flexibility in choosing the best model for your needs.

## Installation

### Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap jingkaihe/kodelet
brew install kodelet
```

### Via Install Script

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jingkaihe/kodelet/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Updating

To update Kodelet to the latest version:

```bash
kodelet update
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
kodelet update --version 0.0.24.alpha
```

## Quick Start

After installation, initialize your repository with context for Kodelet:

```bash
# Bootstrap AGENTS.md with workspace-specific context
kodelet run -r init
```

This analyzes your repository and creates an `AGENTS.md` file that helps Kodelet understand your project's structure, tech stack, conventions, and key commands.

For more details on fragments/recipes, see [docs/FRAGMENTS.md](docs/FRAGMENTS.md).

## Choice of LLM

Kodelet supports both Anthropic Claude and OpenAI models. Currently, we recommend using Claude Sonnet 4 Sonnet for standard requests and Claude 3.5 Haiku for lightweight tasks.
